# Martyr-Records-Management-System-in-Java
This Java project manages a list of Palestinian martyr records from a CSV file, handling data like name, age, and date of death. It implements an array-based list that resizes dynamically and provides a JavaFX GUI for users to add, delete, search, and filter records by age, gender, or date, demonstrating core object-oriented programming principles.
