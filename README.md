# Martyr-Records-Management-System-in-Java
The project demonstrates key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation is achieved by organizing the martyr records and list structure into appropriate classes with private fields and public methods for accessing and modifying the data. Inheritance can be utilized if there is a need to create specialized types of records or list structures, while polymorphism may be applied for handling different operations like insertion, deletion, and searching uniformly through method overriding. Additionally, abstraction is applied to hide the internal workings of the list management and resizing from the user interface, ensuring a clean separation between the data logic and GUI.
